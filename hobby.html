                <h1 class="headings">Drawing</h1>
                <p>I really love drawing since in middle school. My role model in drawing is my own sister. She is so talented and I really want to be like her someday. Actually, my ambition is to become architecture. I even have undergone an interview but did not pass at the end but it's okay, the past is the past and I am more happier now.</p>

                <img src="image/imgmusic.jpeg" alt="">
                <h1 class="headings">Music</h1>
                <p>While I draw, I listen to music especially K-POP. I also listen to Malay music but not frequently. I want recommended you to listen song that I put here. You can press play to listen to it. Have fun!</p>

                <h1 class="headings">Photography</h1>
                <p>I also like to take a picture. Sometimes, I become photographer for my own sisters. Thanks to my own sister, I have become photographer for a day using the real camera. So, that is why in my website there will be no picture of me because I always take picture of someone else especially my sisters.</p>
